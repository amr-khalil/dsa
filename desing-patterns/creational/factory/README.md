### The Factory Design Pattern

provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Here are some reasons why and when to use the Factory Design Pattern:

**Decoupling**: The Factory pattern allows you to *decouple the creation of objects* from the class that needs the objects. This makes your code more modular and easier to read and maintain.

**Flexibility**: The Factory pattern allows you to introduce new types of products into your system without breaking existing code.
This is because the Factory pattern uses a common interface for all products, so as long as the new product adheres to this interface, the code that uses the product can remain unchanged.
 
**Simplification**: The Factory pattern can simplify your code by hiding the complexities of object creation. The client code does not need to know anything about how the object is created, what concrete classes are involved, or what dependencies the object has.

You should use the Factory Design Pattern when:

The creation process is complex and involves logic that shouldn't be in the client code.
The product is part of a hierarchy of product types and the client should be decoupled from this hierarchy.
The system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of products.
You want to provide a library of products and reveal only their interfaces, not their implementations.
