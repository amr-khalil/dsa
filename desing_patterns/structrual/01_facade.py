"""
In English, the word facade means a deceptive front or appearance. Following this definition,
a facade pattern provides a simpler interface that hides the complex functionalities of a system.
This is widely used in JavaScript libraries like jQuery.

The facade pattern allows you to hide all the messy logic from the client and only display
the clear and easy-to-use interface to them. This allows them to interact with an API easily 
in a less error-prone way and without accessing the inner workings directly.

When to use the facade pattern?
The facade pattern is used to simplify a clientâ€™s interaction with a system.
So, it can be used when an application has a large and complex underlying code that the client does not need to see.
It can also be used when you want to interact with the methods present in a library
without knowing the processing that happens in the background.
An example can be of the JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
