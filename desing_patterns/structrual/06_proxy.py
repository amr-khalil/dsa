"""
What is the proxy pattern?
As the name implies, the proxy pattern is a structural pattern that creates a proxy object.
It acts as a placeholder for another object, controlling the access to it.
Usually, an object has an interface with several properties/methods that a client can access.
However, an object might not be able to deal with the clientsâ€™ requests alone due to heavy load or constraints such as dependency on a remote source that might cause delays (e.g., network requests).
In these situations, adding a proxy helps in dividing the load with the target object.
The proxy object looks exactly like the target object.
A client might not even know that they are accessing the proxy object instead of the target object.
The proxy handles the requests from the clients and forwards them to the target object,
preventing undue pressure on the target.

when to use the proxy pattern?
The proxy pattern tries to reduce the workload on the target object.
You can use it when dealing with heavy applications that perform a lot of network requests.
Since delays could occur when responding to such requests, using a proxy pattern will allow the target object to not get overburdened with requests.
A real-life example is HTTP requests.
These are expensive operations, therefore, the proxy pattern helps in reducing the number of requests forwarded to the target.
