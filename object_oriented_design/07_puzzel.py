"""
R1: Our board will be in the shape of a rectangle.
R2: All pieces will have four sides that can either have an indentation, an extrusion, or a flat edge.
R3: There are four corner pieces, some edge pieces, and the remaining ones are the middle pieces. A corner piece has two flat sides, an edge piece only has one flat side, and a middle piece doesnâ€™t have any flat edge.
R4: All pieces will be unique, so only one piece will fit with one other piece.
R5: Two pieces fit together by the curvature of the indentation on one piece matching up to the curvature of the extrusion on another.
