"""
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
